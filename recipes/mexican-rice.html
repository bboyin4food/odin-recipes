<h4>Description</h4>
    <p>No Mexican dish is complete without a well seasoned side of fluffy red rice. 
        This is a recipe I have been working on for some time, and have worked it down 
        to a science at this point. I have always struggled to get the rice to the pefect 
        consistency and have found the trick is in having the correct amount of liquid 
        and the right amount of heat. Aside from that, feel free to experiement with ingredients 
        as you see fit for flavor and spice"</p>
